# Introduction

This document presents R code

+ to simulate VA deaths,
+ to create SCI from reference deaths with known cause,
+ that implements each of the four algorithms - Naive Bayes Classifier, InterVA, InSilicoVA, and Tariff
+ to calculate concordance matrices of assigned causes
+ to calculate and compare CSMF Accuracies
+ to conduct simulated cross-validation studies of VA algorithm performance, holding VA deaths and SCI constant, and 
+ to conduct a heuristic investigation of the effects of SCI on VA algorithm performance.

R functions are defined for most of the activities above.  These can be reused easily and loaded all at once from the file 'Model-VA-Functions.R' using the R command 'source(file="Model-VA-Functions.R").

```{r}
rm(list=ls())
source(file="./Model-VA-Functions.R")
ls()
```

All of the code developed and presented below is for **heuristic** demonstration and pedagogical use *only*.  The code replicates only the *core logic* of each algorithm without important additional funcationality that is present in all real-world software implementations of the algorithms.  

## VA Data

VA data consist of deaths (rows) with a set of binary symptoms (columns).  Reference deaths are VA deaths that also have a *true* cause.  Reference deaths are used to prepare SCI or assess the accuracy of causes assigned by algorithms (or any other mechanism).

## Symptom-Cause Information (SCI)

Symptom-Cause Information is  any representation of the *true* relationship between VA symptoms and causes of death.  SCI can be prepared from refernece deaths, or it can come from another source.  When SCI is prepared from reference deaths it captures the true (or observed) relationship between VA symptoms and causes in the dataset of reference deaths, so it is limited by whatever information exists about that relationship in that specific set of reference deaths. Alternativelt SCI can be compiled from other sources of information that describe how symptoms relate to causes.  Not all forms of SCI are perfect and they all have limitations based on how thye were derived.  Many of the algorithms use SCI that do not account for dependence among symptoms for deaths from a given cause.  

## VA Cause-Coding Algorithms

VA cause-coding algorithms are effectively logical devices that combine VA data collected from deaths with SCI to assign causes of death that are jointly consistent with the symptoms in the collected VAs and the particular SCI used.  VA algorithms are often a combination of logic and computation and sometimes contain statistical procedures as well, e.g. InSilicoVA.  Algorithms vary in the inputs they require and the outputs they produce, and some algorithms also include significant data checking/editing functions that are run before the algorithm. The code presented below implements the core logic of each algorithm without any of additional data checking/edition or other extra funcationality included in all real-world versions of the algorithms.

# Symptom-Cause Information

Create a function that converts an expandable list of SCI into a neat, usable matrix of SCI values.

```{r}
###### <<Function>>
storeSCI <- function (SCIlist) {
 
  # converts a list of p(s|c) SCI vectors into a labeled matrix
  
  # SCIlist: a list of 5-element SCI vectors, each element betweten 0.0 and 1.0
  # return a labeled cause x p(s|c) matrix

  # create matrix from list
  SCI.mat <- matrix(unlist(SCIlist), ncol = 5, byrow = TRUE)
  # label columns
  colnames(SCI.mat) <- c("s1","s2","s3","s4","s5")
  # label rows
  # initialize row labels vector
  sci.rownames <- "cause1"
  # loop through causes
  for (i in 2:nrow(SCI.mat)) {
    # append each cause to row labels vector
    sci.rownames <- c(sci.rownames,paste("cause",i,sep=""))
  }
  rownames(SCI.mat) <- sci.rownames
  
  # return matrix of SCI
  return(SCI.mat)

}
```

Create an matrix of $\Pr(s|c)$ SCI values.

```{r}
# create de novo SCI consisting of conditional probabilities p(s|c): causes x 5 symptoms
# you can add or subtract causes, i.e. rows below
SCI.denovo <- list()
SCI.denovo[[1]] <- c(0.90,  0.40,  0.10,  0.01,  0.80)
SCI.denovo[[2]] <- c(0.30,  0.41,  0.80,  0.75,  0.90)
SCI.denovo[[3]] <- c(0.10,  0.01,  0.01,  0.95,  0.80)
SCI.denovo[[4]] <- c(0.05,  0.90,  0.75,  0.50,  0.20)
# have a look at the list of SCI
SCI.denovo
# store the SCI into a matrix
SCI.denovo.mat <- storeSCI(SCI.denovo)
# have a look at the matrix of SCI
SCI.denovo.mat
```

# Simulate Deaths

Create a function to simulate some deaths from a matrix of SCI.  For each death, first draw a cause, and then for each symptom, draw a binary value corresponding to whether or not the symptom appears for that death.  The causes are drawn according to a set of CSMFs provided as a pameter, and the symptoms are drawn according to the matrix of SCI provided as a parameter.

```{r}
###### <<Function>>
simulateDeaths <- function (simDeaths.num,csmf,psc.mat) {
  
  # simulates a set of VA deaths using p(s|c) SCI and CSMFs provided
  
  # simDeaths.num is the number of deaths to simulate
  # csmf is a vector of fractions, one for each cause
  # psc.mat is matrix of conditional probabilities p(s|c)
  # return 
  #   * simDeaths: a labeled deaths x cause,symptoms matrix of simulated deaths
  
  # initialize vector simulated deaaths matrix
  simDeaths <- c()
  #loop over deaths
  for (i in 1:simDeaths.num) {
    # draw a cause, 1 or 2
    cause <- which(rmultinom(1,1,csmf)==1)
    # select he correct set of conditional probabilities for drawing symptoms
    psc <- psc.mat[cause,]
    # draw symptoms conditional on this cause
    # initialize symptoms vector
    symptoms <- c()
    # loop over symptoms
    for (s in 1:5) {
      symptoms <- c(symptoms,rbinom(1,1,psc[s]))
    }
    # add this death to the deaths matrix
    simDeaths <- rbind(simDeaths,c(cause,symptoms))
  }
  # name the columns
  # initialize column names vector
  death.colnames <- c("cause","s1")
  # add symptom labels
  for (s in 2:5) {
    death.colnames <- c(death.colnames,paste("s",s,sep=""))
  }
  colnames(simDeaths) <- death.colnames
  # initialize row names vector
  death.rownames <- "death1"
  # add row labels
  for (i in 2:nrow(simDeaths)) {
    death.rownames <- c(death.rownames,paste("death",i,sep=""))
  }
  rownames(simDeaths) <- death.rownames
  
  # return simulated deaths
  return(simDeaths)

}
```

Simulate some deaths from the SCI matrix we created earlier.  First create a set of CSMFs for the four causes that we defined in the SCI.


```{r}
# fraction of deaths that are for each cause: cause1, cause2, etc.
csmf <- c(0.25,0.45,0.2,0.1)
sum(csmf) # check that the elements of csmf add to 1.0

# simulate 1000 deaths with the numbers of each determined by csmf and the symptoms generated
#   by the conditional probabilities in psc.mat
simDeaths <- simulateDeaths(1000,csmf,SCI.denovo.mat)
# have a look
head(simDeaths)
# have a look at the dimensions 
dim(simDeaths)

# count the deaths by cause
table(simDeaths[,1])

# CSMF of the simulated deaths
table(simDeaths[,1])/1000

# for deaths of cause 1, count the those with/without symptom 1
num <- table(simDeaths[which(simDeaths[,1]==1),2])[2]
den <- sum(table(simDeaths[which(simDeaths[,1]==1),2]))
num/den # P(s1 | c1): yes it matches
# for deaths of cause 1, count the those with/without symptom 2
table(simDeaths[which(simDeaths[,1]==1),3])
# for deaths of cause 1, count the those with/without symptom 2
table(simDeaths[which(simDeaths[,1]==1),4])
# for deaths of cause 1, count the those with/without symptom 2
table(simDeaths[which(simDeaths[,1]==1),5])
# for deaths of cause 1, count the those with/without symptom 2
table(simDeaths[which(simDeaths[,1]==1),6])

# for deaths of cause 2, count the those with/without symptom 1
table(simDeaths[which(simDeaths[,1]==2),2])
```

# Sample Simulated Deaths for Train/Test Split

Select a sample of simulated deaths.  The sample will be used to create SCI, and the rest of the deaths will be used as test deaths to investigate the performance of the algorithms.

```{r}
# set the fraction of deaths to sample
samp.frac <- 0.5
# draw the sample
sample <- sample(nrow(simDeaths),samp.frac*nrow(simDeaths))
# have a look at the first few elements of the sample: these are the row numbers of the sampled deaths
head(sample)

# create a dataset of the sampol
SCIdeaths <- simDeaths[sample,]
# have a look at the new set of deaths
head(SCIdeaths)
# make sure the number corresponds to the sample fraction
dim(SCIdeaths)
# complement of the sample is for testing
testDeaths <- simDeaths[(-sample),]
head(testDeaths)
dim(testDeaths)

# make sure the SCI and test deaths are completely complementary sets
# match tests if any element of v1 is found in v2 and returns an 'NA' if not
# all tests if *all* the elements of the result of is.na() are 'NA'
# expect a single valued respons of 'TRUE'
all(is.na(match(rownames(SCIdeaths),rownames(testDeaths))))
```

# Calculate CSMFs

Create a function to calculate the CSMFs corresponding to a set of deaths.

```{r}
###### <<Function>>
calcCSMF <- function (deaths) {
  
  # calculate CSMFs for a set of deaths
  
  # deaths is a deaths x cause,symptoms matrix of deaths
  # retuns a causes-element vector of CSMFs
  
  # identify unique causes
  causes <- sort(unique(deaths[,1]))
  # initialize vector of CSMFs
  csmfs <- c()
  # loop over causes 
  for (c in 1:length(causes)) {
    # calculate the fraction of deaths with cause c and add it to the matrix of CSMFs
    csmfs <- c(csmfs,nrow(deaths[which(deaths[,1]==c),])/nrow(deaths))
  }
  # make csmfs result into a matrix
  csmfs <- matrix(csmfs,nrow=1)
  # label columns
  csmfs.colnames <- "cause1"
  for (i in 2:length(causes)) {
    csmfs.colnames <- c(csmfs.colnames,paste("cause",i,sep=""))
  }
  colnames(csmfs) <- csmfs.colnames
  # label rows - subsitute() returns the name of its input
  rownames (csmfs) <- c(substitute(deaths))

  # return CSMFs
  return(csmfs)
  
}
```

Calculate the CSMFs of the test deaths and be sure that they are similar to the CSMFs provided when they were simulated.

```{r}
testDeaths.CSMF <- calcCSMF(testDeaths)
# have a look and ensure that they correspond to the csmf used to simulate the deaths
testDeaths.CSMF
# csmf used to simulate the deaths
csmf
```

The match is good.

# Calculate SCI from Reference Deaths

Create a function to calculate SCI from a set of deaths with a reference cause.  For all the deaths of a given cause, for each symptom, calculate the fraction of deaths for which the symptom exists.

```{r}
###### <<Function>>
calcSCI <- function(deaths) {
  
  # calculate SCI from a set of deaths with causes and symptoms
  
  # deaths is a deaths x cause,symptoms matrix of deaths
  # return a cause x symptoms matrix of conditional probabilities p(s|c)
  
  # identify unique causes
  causes <- sort(unique(deaths[,1]))
  # initialize list of vectors of SCI
  sci <- list()
  # loop over causes
  for (c in 1:length(causes)) {
    # calculate the fraction of deaths with each symptom for this cause
    # add the result vector to the list of SCI
    sci[[c]] <- colSums(deaths[which(deaths[,1]==c),2:6])/nrow(deaths[which(deaths[,1]==c),])
  }
  # convert the list to a matrix
  sci <- matrix(unlist(sci), ncol = 5, byrow = TRUE)
  colnames(sci) <- c("s1","s2","s3","s4","s5")
  # initialize row labels vector
  sci.rownames <- "cause1"
  # loop over causes and create row labels vector
  for (i in 2:length(causes)) {
    # append each cause to row labels vector
    sci.rownames <- c(sci.rownames,paste("cause",i,sep=""))
  }
  rownames(sci) <- sci.rownames
  
  # return cause x symptoms matrix of SCI
  return(sci)
  
}
```

Calculate SCI from the the sample of SCI deaths, created above.

```{r}
# calculate SCI from the datasset of SCI deaths
SCIdeaths.SCI <- calcSCI(SCIdeaths)
# have a look at the SCI 
SCIdeaths.SCI

# check to be sure that the calculated SCI is similar to the SCI used to simulate the deaths
# have a look at the calculated SCI rounded to 2 decimal places
round(SCIdeaths.SCI,2)
# have a look at the SCI used to simulate the deaths that were used to calculate the SCI
SCI.denovo.mat
# calculate and display the differences between the two
round(SCIdeaths.SCI,2)-SCI.denovo.mat
```

Calculate the CSMFs of the SCI deaths.

```{r}
# calculate CSMFs for SCIdeaths
SCIdeaths.CSMF <- calcCSMF(SCIdeaths)
SCIdeaths.CSMF
sum(SCIdeaths.CSMF)
csmf
```

This looks good.

# Create Dataset of User-defined (Arbitrary) Deaths

Create a function that converts an expandable list of VA deaths into a neat, usable matrix of VA death symptom values, similar to teh storeSCI function above.

```{r}
###### <<Function>>
storeVADeaths <- function (deathList) {

  # converts a list of VA death vectors into a labeled matrix
  
  # deathList: a list of 5-element VA symptom vectors, each element 0 or 1
  # return a labeled death x symptoms matrix
   
  # create a matrix with the deaths & signs/symptoms: rows for deaths, columns for signs/symptoms
  deaths.mat <- matrix(unlist(deathList), ncol = 5, byrow = TRUE)
  # label columns
  colnames <- c("s1","s2","s3","s4","s5")
  colnames(deaths.mat) <- colnames
  # label rows
  # initialize row labels vector
  death.rownames <- "death1"
  # loop over deaths
  for (i in 2:nrow(deaths.mat)) {
    # append each death top row labels vector
    death.rownames <- c(death.rownames,paste("death",i,sep=""))
  }
  rownames(deaths.mat) <- death.rownames
  
  # return labeled matrix of ddeaths
  return(deaths.mat)
  
}
```

Create a matrix of deaths with symptoms from an example list of VA deaths.  This list can be edited, expanded, or contracted to create an arbitrary set of VA deaths.

```{r}
# create a list of n VA deaths with 5 binary signs/symptoms each
VAs <- list()

# make up 10 VA deaths, each with 5 symptoms
VAs[[1]]  <- c(0,1,1,1,1)
VAs[[2]]  <- c(1,1,0,0,0)
VAs[[3]]  <- c(0,1,0,0,1)
VAs[[4]]  <- c(1,1,1,0,1)
VAs[[5]]  <- c(0,1,0,1,1)
VAs[[6]]  <- c(1,1,0,0,1)
VAs[[7]]  <- c(0,1,1,0,1)
VAs[[8]]  <- c(1,1,1,0,1)
VAs[[9]]  <- c(0,0,0,0,1)
VAs[[10]] <- c(0,1,0,0,0)

# Create a matrix of deaths x symptoms
VAexampleDeaths <- storeVADeaths(VAs)
# have a look at the VA deaths dataset
VAexampleDeaths
```

# Naive Bayes Classifier Algorithm

Create a function to implement the Naive Bayes Classifier (NBC) VA coding algorithm.  Comments in the code explain each step.

```{r}
###### <<Function>>
calcNBC <- function(SCI,SCI.c,deaths) {

# create a 'VAdeaths' dataset from the test deaths
VAdeaths <- testDeaths[,2:6] # test deaths

# assign causes to the test deaths using the NBC algorithm
NBC.results <- calcNBC(SCIdeaths.SCI,prob.c,VAdeaths)
```

Have a look at the causes assigned to each death.

```{r}

Use the InterVA algorithm to identify causes for the test deaths created above, and then look at all the elements of the list of results returned by the *calcInterVA()* function.

```{r}
# define inputs for test
# prob.c is set of (marginal) p(c)
prob.c <- rep(1/nrow(SCIdeaths.SCI),nrow(SCIdeaths.SCI)) # don't know what it is, so uniform distribution
# prob.c <- csmf # use the correct marginals
# verify that it's what you expect
prob.c

# create a 'VAdeaths' dataset from the test deaths
VAdeaths <- testDeaths[,2:6] # test deaths

# assign causes to the test deaths using the InterVA algorithm
InterVA.results <- calcInterVA(SCIdeaths.SCI,prob.c,VAdeaths)
```

Have a look at the results, very similar to the NBC algorithm above.

```{r}

Assign causes to the test deaths using the InSilicoVA VA cause-coding algorithm.  InSilicoVA is different from the others and uses a sampling procedure to approximate the distributions of CSMFs and cause-assignment probabilities for each death.  Because of this it takes longer to run and produces a number of additional outputs.

```{r}
# define inputs for test
# prob.c is set of (marginal) p(c)
prob.c <- rep(1/nrow(SCIdeaths.SCI),nrow(SCIdeaths.SCI)) # don't know what it is, so uniform distribution
# prob.c <- csmf # use the correct marginals
# verify that it's what you expect
prob.c
# test

# create a 'VAdeaths' dataset from the test deaths
VAdeaths <- testDeaths[,2:6] # test deaths

# assign casues to the test deaths using the InSilicoVA VA cause-coding algorithm
# With 500 samples, InSilicoVA takes about 20 seconds to run on a fast laptop, 
#   maybe longer on your computer
InSilicoVA.results <- calcInSilicoVA(SCIdeaths.SCI,prob.c,VAdeaths,500,0.05)
# for faster testing ...
# InSilicoVA.results <- calcInSilicoVA(SCIdeaths.SCI,prob.c,VAdeaths,5,0.05)
```

Have a look at the InSilicoVA resutls. There are outputs simmilar to the NBC and InterVA outputs, and there are additional InSilicoVA-specific outputs.  

```{r}
head(InSilicoVA.results$top.cause)
```

InSilicoVA produces estimated distributions of cause-assignment probabilities for each death.  Have a look at the medians and means of those distributions for each death.

```{r}
head(InSilicoVA.results$cause.probabilities)
```

InSilicoVA produces estimated distributions of CSMFs.  Have a look at the medians of those distributions.

```{r}
InSilicoVA.results$csmf.median
```

Have a look at the five-number summary of the estimated CSMF distributions.

```{r}
InSilicoVA.results$csmf.fivenum
```

```{r}
InSilicoVA.results$time
```

Have a look at the intermediate values produced by InSilicoVA for the individual cause-assignment probabilities assigned to each death at each iteration.

```{r}
head(InSilicoVA.results$pi)
```

There are 500 iterations for 500 deaths; one probability for each of four causes.

```{r}
dim(InSilicoVA.results$pi)
```

Have a look at the intermediate values produced by InSilicoVA for the causes assigned to each death at each iteration.

```{r}
head(InSilicoVA.results$Y)
```

There are 500 iterations for 500 deaths; one of the four causes is assigned at each iteration.


```{r}
dim(InSilicoVA.results$Y)
```

Have a look at the intermediate values produced by InSilicoVA for the CSMFs assigned at each iteration.


```{r}
head(InSilicoVA.results$C)
```

There a CSMF for each of the four causes at each of the 500 iterations.

```{r}
dim(InSilicoVA.results$C)

## InSilicoVA Plotting

Create a funcion to plot various outputs from InSilicoVA.  The plotting function creates PDF files and saves them in the specified directory.  The plots inlude

  + convergence plots for individual cause-assignment probabilities for each cause for each death
  + histograms for individual cause-assignment probability distributions for each cause for each death
  + histograms of estimated CSMF distributions 
  + boxplots of estimated CSMF disributions

The plotting function requires a 'results' object produced by InSilicoVA.  This contains all the deaths and intermediate values that are required for plotting.  

```{r}

  # plotting functions for InSilicoVA results
  
  # results is an InSilicoVA results list
  # path points to where you want PDF files save, relative to the working directory
  #   must be in form './figs/' including last slash
  # if conv=1, create convergence plots
  # if pi=1, create histograms of pi
  # if csmfH=1, create CSMF histograms
  # if csmfB=1, create CSMF boxplots
  
  # create a list of cause names
  causes <- c("Cause 1")
  for (c in 2:nrow(results$sci)) {
    causes <- c(causes,paste("Cause",c))
  }
  # create a set of colors, one for each cause

  # grab the deaths from the results
  deaths <- results$deaths
  
  # assess sample convergence: plot the probability of being assigned
  #   to each cause by sample
  if (conv==1) {
    # loop over deaths
    for (d in 1:nrow(deaths)) {
      # loop over causes

        title <- paste("death ",d,","," cause ",c,sep="")
        file.name <- paste(path,"convergence-death",d,",","cause",c,".pdf",sep="")
        pdf(file=file.name)
        # plot pi by sample
        plot(results$pi[,c,d],ylim=c(0,1),main=title,xlab="Sample",ylab="Probability")
        dev.off()
      }
    }
  }
  
  # a single histogram for each death with all cause-assignment probability distributions
  if (pi==1) {
    # loop over deaths
    for (d in 1:nrow(deaths)) {
      pdf(paste(path,"cause-distributions-death",d,".pdf",sep=""))
      hist(results$pi[,1,d],col=colors.cause[1],xlim=c(0,1),main=paste("Death",d),xlab="Probability")
      for (c in 2:nrow(results$sci)) {
        hist(results$pi[,c,d],col=colors.cause[c],add=T)
      }
      legend("topright",causes,fill=colors.cause)
      dev.off()
    }
  }
  
  # plot CSMFs on one plot
  if (csmfH==1) {
    pdf(paste(path,"CSMFs.pdf",sep=""))
    hist(results$C[,1],col=colors.cause[1],main="CSMFs",xlab="Probability",xlim=c(0,1))
    for (c in 2:nrow(results$sci)) {
      hist(results$C[,c],col=colors.cause[c],add=T)
    }
    legend("topright",causes,fill=colors.cause)
    dev.off()
  }

  # boxplots of the CSMFs
  if (csmfB==1) {
    pdf(paste(path,"CSMF-boxplots.pdf",sep=""))
    boxplot(results$C,names=causes,main="Summary of CSMF Distributions")
    dev.off()
  }
  
}
```

Test the plotting function. PDFs containing plots will be stored in '../figure/insilicova/'.  This takes some time and saves many files, so evaluation is set to 'FALSE'.  If you want to run it, change that to 'TRUE'.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
getwd()
plotInSilicoVA(InSilicoVA.results,"../figure/insilicova/",1,0,0,0)
plotInSilicoVA(InSilicoVA.results,"../figure/insilicova/",0,1,0,0)
plotInSilicoVA(InSilicoVA.results,"../figure/insilicova/",0,0,1,0)
plotInSilicoVA(InSilicoVA.results,"../figure/insilicova/",0,0,0,1)
```

Use the Tariff algorithm to identify causes for the test deaths created above, and then look at all the elements of the list of results returned by the *calcTariff()* function.

```{r}
# create a 'VAdeaths' dataset from the test deaths
VAdeaths <- testDeaths[,2:6] # test deaths

# assign causes to the test deaths using the InterVA algorithm
# set 'normalize' to TRUE and 'resample' to TRUE so that Tariff is run the way it was originally written 
Tariff.results <- calcTariff(SCIdeaths,VAdeaths,TRUE,TRUE)
```

Tariff causes are assigned by choosing the cause with the largest normalized Tariff Score, Q, value.

```{r}
head(Tariff.results$top.cause)
```

Tariff does not produce probabilities for each cause.  What it does produce are normalized Tariff Scores or 'Q' values.  Have a look at those for each cause for each death

```{r}
head(Tariff.results$cause.tariffScores)
```

Tariff CSMFs are calculated by summing assigned causes.

```{r}
Tariff.results$csmf
```

```{r}
Tariff.results$when
```

```{r}
head(Tariff.results$deaths)
```

```{r}
Tariff.results$tariffs
```

Look at the (resampled) gold standard death Tariff scores.  The reason for the last ranking step in comparing Tariff scores is because for each cause the Tariff scores have a characteristic value and distribution, so they are not directly comparable.  What is comparable is their rank withing the gold standard distributions of Tariff Scores. Below the different characteristic values for each cause are obvious.

```{r}
# have a look at the gold standard tariff scores dataset
head(Tariff.results$scores.gs)
dim(Tariff.results$scores.gs)
# loop through causes and have a look at the summary statistics for the distributions of 
#   gold standard tariff scores for the 
num.causes <- ncol(Tariff.results$scores.gs)
for (c in 1:num.causes) {
  print(colnames(Tariff.results$scores.gs)[c])
  print(summary(Tariff.results$scores.gs[which(Tariff.results$deaths.gs[,1]==c),c]))
}
```

Calculate and comapare the CSMF Accuracies of all four algorithms.

```{r}
# test
# create named list of CSMFs; names will be used throughout, so must be meaningful
# repeats test for expandable list of inputs

  NBC.top = NBC.results$csmf.topCause,
  InterVA.frac = InterVA.results$csmf.fracDeath,
  InterVA.top = InterVA.results$csmf.topCause,
  InSilicoVA = InSilicoVA.results$csmf.median,

)
# calculate CSMF accuracies
CSMF.accuracies <- calcCSMFaccuracies(CSMFs,testDeaths.CSMF)
CSMF.accuracies$CSMF.accuracies
```

The larger the CSMF Accuracy, the closer the algorithm came to the truth or reference deaths.  A value of 1.0 means that the CMSFs match the reference deaths exactly.  This is always true when the reference deaths are compared to themsevles, 'cause' above, and usually InSilicoVA is has the largest CSMF Accuracy in this test.  The consistent ranking is InSilicoVA followed by either InterVA.top or Tariff.  

# Cross Validation

Create a function to run a cross validation simulation.  The inputs are a set of SCI and a set of CSMFs. A set of deaths are simulated using those and then sampled using an input sampling fraction.  The sample of deaths are used to prepare a set of SCI, and the remaining deaths are used as test deaths.  Starting from the simulated deaths, the idea is to test the algorithms using the same SCI, and additionally, having that SCI come from the same population of deaths.  The algorithms are all run using the prepared SCI and tested on the same test deaths, and the results from each are compared.

for (sim in 1:sims) {

  # print the sim number  
  print(sim)
  # run the cross validation
  crossVal <- crossValidate(SCI.denovo,csmf,sim.deaths,samp.frac,insilico.iter)
  # store the csmf comparisons and concordance matrix
  csmf.list[[sim]] <- crossVal$CSMFaccuracies.list$CSMF.accuracies
  discord.list[[sim]] <- crossVal$concordance.list$percent.correct

}
```

Have a look at the results.  First calculate the fraction of the number of simulations won by each algorithm in terms of CSMF Accuracy.

```{r}
# create a matix of CSMF Accuracies - rows are simulations, columns are CSMF Accuracies for each algorithm
# the number of columns is the number of CSMF accuracies
csmf.mat <- matrix(unlist(csmf.list),ncol=length(csmf.list[[1]]),byrow=TRUE)
# name the columns of csmf.mat using the algorithm names from the CSMF Accuracies
colnames(csmf.mat) <- names(csmf.list[[1]])
# remove the 'reference' CSMF Accuracy
csmf.mat <- csmf.mat[,2:ncol(csmf.mat)]
# identify the maximum CSMF Accuracy by row, i.e. which algorithm won
csmf.max <- apply(csmf.mat,1,max)
# loop through the simulations, rows, and identify which column has the maximum CSMF Accuracy
csmf.winner <- c()
for (s in 1:length(csmf.max)) {
  csmf.winner <- c(csmf.winner,which(csmf.mat[s,]==csmf.max[s]))
}
# create a table of the fraction of simulations won by each algorithm
winner.fracs <- table(csmf.winner)/length(csmf.max)
# identify the names of the winning algorithms and label the winner.fracs columns
names(winner.fracs) <- colnames(csmf.mat)[as.numeric(names(winner.fracs))]
# display the winning fractions as percents: percent of cross validation simulations won by each algorithm
100*winner.fracs 
```

Now compare the average across all simulations of the percent correct cause assignments for each algorithm.

```{r}
# create a matrix of zeroes corresponding to the matrix of percent correct cause assignments
d <- discord.list[[1]] - discord.list[[1]]
# loop over allf the simulations and cummulate the percent correct  
for (i in 1:sims) {
  d <- d + discord.list[[i]]
}
# divide the total discordant counts by the number of simulations
d <- round(d/sims,0)
# average percent correct cause cause assignments in 'sims' simulations
d 
```

# Characterizing the Effects of SCI

Changing the SCI should have an effect on how VA algorithms assign causes. Below we conduct a heuristic exploration of this effect by creating different SCI and then using them with each algorithm to assign causes to the test deaths. We compare the results to those produced by running each algorithm on the test deaths using the correct SCI, i.e. the SCI produced from the complementary sample of the simulated deaths, above.  

Start by defining SCI, simulating deaths with that SCI, and dividing the simulated deaths into 'SCI' and 'test deaths' by drawing a random sample - same as above.  

```{r}
# create de novo SCI consisting of conditional probabilities p(s|c): causes x 5 symptoms
# you can add or subtract causes, i.e. rows below
SCI.denovo <- list()
SCI.denovo[[1]] <- c(0.90,  0.40,  0.10,  0.01,  0.80)
SCI.denovo[[2]] <- c(0.30,  0.41,  0.80,  0.75,  0.90)
SCI.denovo[[3]] <- c(0.10,  0.01,  0.01,  0.95,  0.80)
SCI.denovo[[4]] <- c(0.05,  0.90,  0.75,  0.50,  0.20)
# define a set of CSMFs, fraction of deaths that are for each cause: cause1, cause2, etc.
# number of deaths to simulate
sim.deaths <- 1000
csmf <- c(0.25,0.45,0.2,0.1)
# sample for preparing SCI
samp.frac <- 0.5

# store SCI defined above
SCI <- storeSCI(SCI.denovo)
# simulate a bunch of deaths using the SCI and csmf defined above
simDeaths <- simulateDeaths(sim.deaths,csmf,SCI)
head(simDeaths)

# draw sample for to prepare SCI
sample <- sample(nrow(simDeaths),samp.frac*nrow(simDeaths))
# select the sampled deaths to be used to create SCI
SCIdeaths <- simDeaths[sample,]
# select the inverse of the sample as deaths for testing
testDeaths <- simDeaths[(-sample),]
```

Calculate the CSMFs of the test deaths.

```{r}
# calcualte the CSMF of the SCI and test deaths
testDeaths.CSMF <- calcCSMF(testDeaths)
```

Create SCI from the 'sample' deaths.  This is the *true* SCI derived from deaths that are indistinguishable from the test deaths.

```{r}
# calcualte SCI from the SCI deaths
SCIdeaths.SCI <- calcSCI(SCIdeaths)
```

Create a couple convenience functions to use when creating modified SCI.  *logi()* calculates the logit transform of a number between 0 and 1 and effectively stretches them onto the whole real line.  *expit()* is its inverse.

```{r}
logit <- function(x) {log(x/(1-x))}
expit <- function(x) {exp(x)/(1+exp(x))}
```

Now create a modified SCI matrix.  Start with the real SCI and massage it a bit, and have a look at what's happening as you go.

```{r}
# vector of modifications that can be edited easily
# first element scales whole SCI up or down, around 1.0
# the rest modify symptoms 2,3,5 and cause 3, below
mods <- c(
  1.5,
  -0.5,
  0.9,
  0.7,
  -0.7
)

# scale the whole SCI matrix
SCI.less <- expit(logit(SCI) * mods[1])
# initialize SCI.modified with SCI.less
SCI.modified <- SCI.less

# reduce the influence of symptom 2 on logit scale
SCI.modified[,2] <- expit(logit(SCI.less[,2]) + mods[2])
# increase the influence of symptom 3 by 20% on logit scale
SCI.modified[,3] <- expit(logit(SCI.less[,3]) + mods[3])
# increase the influence of symptom 5 by 75% on logit scale
SCI.modified[,5] <- expit(logit(SCI.less[,5]) + mods[4])
# make all symptoms less likely for cause 3
SCI.modified[3,] <- expit(logit(SCI.less[3,]) + mods[5])
```

Have a look at the original SCI compared to the modified SCI.

```{r}
SCI
SCI.modified
SCI-SCI.modified
```

Run all the algorithms as we have done before using 1) the true SCI, and 2) the modified SCI.  Store the results of both.  

```{r}
# create a starting p(c) for all the methods, a uniform distribution
prob.c <- rep(1/nrow(SCIdeaths.SCI),nrow(SCIdeaths.SCI)) 
VAdeaths <- testDeaths[,2:6]

Review the CSMF Accuracies of each combination of SCI and algorithm, starting with NBC.

Now have a look at how badly each algorithm's performance was degraded by using the modfied SCI.  True CSMF Accuracy minus that produced using the modified SCI.

NBC.

```{r}

```{r}

Wrap it all up so that we can look at both the CSMFs and the difference between the two.
